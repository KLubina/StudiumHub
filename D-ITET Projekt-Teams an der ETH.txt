A thesis project is usually supervised and graded by a lecturer in charge of teaching a Core Course or a course in a Field of Specialization, but any other lecturer of ETH Zurich, who is entitled to supervise master thesis in her or his own department is also eligible.  

All projects in CSE must involve the application of core CSE techniques and must have a strong software implementation component. Algorithm development and implementation, numerical or discrete modeling, or simulations must constitute the main contribution of the student to the project.
